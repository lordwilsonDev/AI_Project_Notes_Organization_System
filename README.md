# NOTES ORGANIZATION SYSTEM
**Part of the AI_Ecosystem | Structured Knowledge Capture**

## PURPOSE
The Notes folder is your structured knowledge repository - different from the raw IDEAS system. While IDEAS captures unfiltered thoughts, Notes organizes processed information, meeting summaries, research findings, and project documentation.

## FOLDER STRUCTURE
- Meeting_Notes: Structured summaries of meetings, calls, and conversations
- Research: Deep dives, analysis, and investigation notes
- Project_Notes: Ongoing project documentation and planning
- Quick_Captures: Rapid note-taking that needs structure later
- Reference: Permanent reference materials and documentation
- SAVE_ZONE: Temporary holding area for external content

## WORKFLOW INTEGRATION
- IDEAS (Raw) -> Processing -> NOTES (Structured) -> Action
- Daily processing workflow for organizing captures
- Vy integration for pattern analysis and insights

## PHILOSOPHY
Notes are the bridge between raw IDEAS and structured action - creating knowledge architecture that grows with you.
